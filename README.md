# Basic HTML Page Website for Modular Exponential Equation Calculation

This is a basic HTML website that calculates modular exponential equations very efficiently. Users can input values for the base, power, and modulus, and the website will calculate the result using the modular exponentiation algorithm. 

## Getting Started

To use this website, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The website will load, and you will see three input fields for the base, power, and modulus. Enter the appropriate values, and then click the "Calculate" button. The result of the modular exponential equation will appear below the button. 

## How It Works

The website uses the modular exponentiation algorithm to calculate the result of the equation. This algorithm efficiently calculates the remainder when a number is raised to a power and then divided by a modulus. 

The algorithm works by breaking down the exponent into its binary representation and then iteratively squaring the base and updating the result. If the current bit of the exponent is 1, then the current result is multiplied by the base. This is done modulo the modulus at each step to avoid large intermediate results. 

## Technologies Used

This website is built using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website is designed to be simple and easy to understand, and the modular exponentiation algorithm is implemented in JavaScript.

## Future Improvements

Some potential improvements to the website include adding input validation to ensure that the user inputs are valid, adding error messages if the user inputs are invalid or the calculation fails, and improving the overall design and user interface of the website.
